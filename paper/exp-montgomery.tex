\section{Experimental results on security of Montgomery form}

\label{sec:experiments-montgomery}
%

\subsection{Experiment 1: Exploiting the symmetry}
%
We conducted two experiments using (single-threaded) MAGMA on Intel
Xeon CPU E7-4830 v4 running at 2~GHz.
%
First, we show that using symmetry on Montgomery curves can
significantly speed up relation collection in index calculus.
%
Specifically, we choose $\F{2^{16} - 165}$, over which we generate
several random Weierstrass and Montgomery curves.
%
We then try to decompose several random points into $m$ points from a
factor base consisting of points whose $x$-coordinates are in \F p.
%
The results of the first experiment are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:exp-sym}.
%
\begin{table}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|r||r|r|r|r|r|r|}
      \hline
      & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Weierstrass} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Montgomery (plain)} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Montgomery (sym.)} \\ \hline\hline
      m & Dreg     & Matcost      & Dreg     & Matcost      & Dreg     & Matcost      \\ \hline
      2 & 2        & 2406.6      & 3        & 3206.7      & 2        & 2406.6      \\ \hline
      3 & 6        & 3466021.3    & 6        & 4344579.2    & 6        & 3465410.9    \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Experimental results for symmetry exploiting on Montgomery curves.}
  \label{tab:exp-sym}
\end{table}
%
In Table~\ref{tab:exp-sym}, we report the degree of regularity (Dreg)
and the matrix cost in MAGMA's F4 algorithm (Matcost).
%
As we can see, without using the symmetry, it generally takes longer
time to decompose over Montgomery curves, whereas it roughly takes the
same amount of time for Weierstrass curves and Montgomery curves after
taking symmetry into account.
