\section{Introduction}
%
In recent years, elliptic curve cryptography is gaining momentum in
deployment, as it can achieve the same level of security as RSA using
much shorter keys and ciphertexts.
%
The security of elliptic curve cryptography is closely related to the
complexity of solving the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem
(ECDLP).
%
Let $p$ be a prime number, and $E$, a nonsingular elliptic curve over
\F{p^n}, the finite field of $p^n$ elements for some positive integer
$n$.
%
That is, $E$ is a plane algebraic curve defined by the equation
$y^2=x^3+ax+b$ for $a,b\in\F{p^n}$ and $\Delta=-16(4a^3+27b^2)\neq 0$.
%
Along with a point at infinity $\mathcal O$, the set of rational
points $E(\F{p^n})$ forms an abelian group with $\mathcal O$ being the
identity.
%
Given $P\in E(\F{p^n})$ and $Q\in\langle P\rangle$, ECDLP is the
problem of finding an integer $\alpha$ such that $Q=\alpha P$.

Today, the best practical attacks against ECDLP are exponential-time,
generic discrete logarithm algorithms such as Pollard's rho
method~\cite{1978-pollard-kangaroo}.
%
However, recently there is a line of research on index calculus
algorithms for ECDLP started by Semaev, Gaudry, and
Diem~\cite{DBLP:journals/iacr/Semaev04,DBLP:journals/jsc/Gaudry09,DBLP:journals/moc/Diem11}.
%
Under certain heuristic assumptions, such algorithms could lead to
subexponential attacks to ECDLP in some
cases~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurocrypt/FaugerePPR12,DBLP:journals/iacr/PetitQ12,DBLP:conf/iwsec/HuangPST13}.
%
The interested reader is referred to a survey paper by Galbraith and
Gaudry for a more comprehensive and in-depth account of the recent
development of ECDLP algorithms along various
directions~\cite{DBLP:journals/dcc/GalbraithG16}.

In this paper, we consider the complexity of solving ECDLP for
elliptic curves in Montgomery form~\cite{1987-montgomery} over optimal
extension fields (OEFs)~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/BaileyP98} using index
calculus algorithms.
%
Recently, Montgomery curves such as
Curve25519~\cite{DBLP:conf/pkc/Bernstein06} have been drawing a lot of
attention in deployment, partly because their scalar multiplication
formula involves only the $x$-coordinates, allowing fast
implementation secure against timing-based side-channel attacks.
%
In general, we can construct Montgomery curves not only over prime
fields such as \F{2^{255}-19} as used in Curve25519 but also extension
fields.
%
An OEF is an extension field from a prime field \F p with $p$ close to
$2^8, 2^{16}, 2^{32}, 2^{64}, \ldots$
%
Such primes fit nicely into the processor words of 8, 16, 32, or
64-bit microprocessors and hence are particularly suitable for
software implementation, allowing for efficient utilization of fast
integer arithmetics on modern
microprocessors~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/BaileyP98}.
%
When it comes to security evaluation using index calculus algorithms,
there have been several papers on, e.g., Edwards
curves~\cite{DBLP:journals/joc/FaugereGHR14,DBLP:conf/indocrypt/GalbraithG14},
but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
discusses the security of Montgomery curves over OEF from such a
viewpoint.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
%
In Section~\ref{sec:index-calculus-ecdlp}, we will give an high-level
overview of the index calculus algorithm for attacking ECDLP.
%
In Section~\ref{sec:montgomery-symmetry}, we will describe Montgomery
curves and how we exploit the symmetry for speeding up index calculus
on them.
%
We will then present our experimental results and conclude this paper
in Section~\ref{sec:experiments-montgomery} and
\ref{sec:experiments-OEF}.
