\begin{abstract}
%
  The security of elliptic curve cryptography is closely related to
  the computational complexity of solving the elliptic curve discrete
  logarithm problem (ECDLP).
%
  Today, the best practical attacks against ECDLP are
  exponential-time, generic discrete logarithm algorithms such as
  Pollard's rho method~\cite{1978-pollard-kangaroo}.
%
  Recently, there is a line of research on index calculus algorithms
  for ECDLP started by Semaev, Gaudry, and
  Diem~\cite{DBLP:journals/iacr/Semaev04,DBLP:journals/jsc/Gaudry09,DBLP:journals/moc/Diem11}.
%
  Under certain heuristic assumptions, such algorithms could lead to
  subexponential attacks to ECDLP in some
  cases~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurocrypt/FaugerePPR12,DBLP:journals/iacr/PetitQ12,DBLP:conf/iwsec/HuangPST13}.
%
  In this paper, we consider the complexity of solving ECDLP for
  elliptic curves in various forms---including
  Hessian~\cite{DBLP:conf/ches/Smart01},
  Montgomery~\cite{1987-montgomery}, (twisted)
  Edwards~\cite{DBLP:journals/iacr/BernsteinL07,DBLP:journals/iacr/BernsteinBJLP08},
  and Weierstrass using index calculus algorithms.
%
  The research question we would like to answer is: Using index
  calculus algorithm, is there any significant difference in the
  computational complexity of solving ECDLP for elliptic curves in
  various forms?
%
  We will provide some insights and empirical evidence showing an
  affirmative answer in this paper.
