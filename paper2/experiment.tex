\section{Experiment}
\label{sec:experiment}

We have conducted a set of experiments to compare the difficulty of
solving ECDLP for four different curves: Hessian($H$), Weierstrass($W$),
Montgomery($M$), and twisted Edwards($tE$) over \F{p^n}.

\subsection{Experimental conditions}
\label{subsec:conditions}

\input{isomorphisms}

As explained in Section~\ref{sec:index-calculus-ecdlp}, we focus on
the PDP computation in these experiments, as the other bottleneck
computation, the linear algebra step is already well understood.
%
We focus on the bottleneck computation in PDP, namely, the cost of the
F4 algorithm for computing Gr\"obner bases for polynomial systems
obtained after rewriting using the elementary symmetric polynomials
and applying the Weil restriction technique to summation polynomials.
%
This way we will be taking advantage of the symmetry of $S_m$ acting
on point decompositions.
% 
However, we \emph{did not} exploit the symmetry of group actions on
point decomposition except the action of $S_m$.
%
This is because we want to compare the \emph{intrinsic} computational
complexity of solving PDP for various curves and hence can only
consider the symmetry that is present in \emph{all} curves.
%
Exploiting further curve-specific symmetry whenever possible will
result in further speed-up, but it would be independent of our
findings here.

All our experiment are done using the MAGMA computation algebra system
(version 2.23-1) on a single core of an Intel Xeon CPU E7-4830 v4
running at 2~GHz.
%
The main cost metrics are running time, Matcost, and the maximum step
degree reached during the execution of the F4 algorithm.
%
The last metric is usually referred to as the ``degree of regularity''
in the literature~\cite{DBLP:conf/indocrypt/GalbraithG14}, which
provides an upper bound for the size of the Macaulay submatrices
involved in the process.
%
The ``Matcost'' is a number output by the MAGMA implementation of the
F4 algorithm and provides an estimate of the linear algebra cost
during the execution of the F4 algorithm.

Lastly, we also focus on ``rank'', which represents the number of 
linearly independent relations we can get once successfully 
solving a PDP instance for each of the four curves.
%
It is also important factor to consider complexity of solving PDP
because rank decide the number of solving PDP which we need 
during the whole sequence of index-calculus attacks.


\subsection{Experimental results}

We present our experimental results for the case of $n=5$.
%
Here our factor base is to take $V$ as the base field \F p of \F{p^n}.
%
\input{result1}

We can clearly see that the PDP solving time and matcost for twisted 
Edwards curve is much faster and smaller than the other three curves 
for different $q$ and $m$.
%
In terms of Dreg, degree for Montgomery and twisted Edwards curve are 
smaller than other curves in the case of $m=4$.
%
Also, we can see that Rank for Hessian and Weierstrass curve is 
1 in all cases.
%
On the other hand, the Rank for Montgomery and twisted Edwards curve
is larger, that is 4 and 5 respectively in the case of $m=3$ and 4.
%
% We further analyze which terms are missing from the summation
% polynomials for curves in different forms.
% %
% We classify terms into odd vs.~even degrees.
% %
% Recall that the polynomials are expressed using elementary symmetric polynomials 
% $e_1, \dots ,e_m$.
% %
% Therefore, a monomial $e_i^j$ has odd degree only if both $i$ and $j$
% are odd.
% %
% For $m=2$, it is interesting that there are no monomials of odd degree
% only for twisted Edwards curve.
% %
% In other words, there are no terms originated from monomial such as
% $e_1$ or $e_1e_2$.
% %
% This is because the addition formula for twisted Edwards curve, based
% on which the summation polynomial is derived, consists of only even
% terms.
% %
% Therefore, when one of the 3 variables in the summation polynomial is
% substituted with the point we want to decompose, the odd-degree terms
% all vanish.

% For $m=3$, we use summation polynomial with 4 variables, which is
% obtained by taking the resultant of two summation polynomials 
% with 3 variables.
% %
% Therefore, there are some odd terms such as $e_3$ or $e_2^2e_3$.
% %
% For $m=4$, there is also no terms with odd degree.
% %
% Through calculating resultant recursively, two variables are
% eliminated, and it preserves all terms to even degree.
