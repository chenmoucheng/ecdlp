\section{Experiments on PDP solving}
\label{sec:experiment}

We have conducted a set of experiments to compare the difficulty of
solving ECDLP for four different curves: Hessian($H$), Weierstrass($W$),
Montgomery($M$), and twisted Edwards($tE$) over \F{p^n}.
%

\subsection{Experimental setup}
\label{subsec:conditions}

\input{isomorphisms}

As explained in Section~\ref{sec:index-calculus-ecdlp}, we focus on
PDP computation in these experiments, as the linear algebra step is
already well understood.
%
Furthermore, we focus on the bottleneck computation in PDP, namely,
the cost of the F4 algorithm for computing Gr\"obner bases for
polynomial systems obtained after rewriting using the elementary
symmetric polynomials and applying the Weil restriction technique to
summation polynomials.
%
This way we will be taking advantage of the symmetry of $S_m$ acting
on point decompositions.
% 
However, we \emph{did not} exploit the symmetry of other group actions
than that of $S_m$.
%
This is because we want to compare the \emph{intrinsic} computational
complexity of PDP solving for various curves and hence only consider
the symmetry that is present in \emph{all} curves.
%
Exploiting further curve-specific symmetry whenever possible will
result in further speed-up, but it would be independent of our
findings here.

All our experiment are done using the MAGMA computation algebra system
(version 2.23-1) on a single core of an Intel Xeon CPU E7-4830 v4
running at 2~GHz.
%
The main cost metrics are running time, Matcost, and the maximum step
degree reached during the execution of the F4 algorithm.
%
The last metric is usually referred to as the ``degree of regularity''
in the literature~\cite{DBLP:conf/indocrypt/GalbraithG14}, which
provides an upper bound for the size of the Macaulay submatrices
involved in the computation.
%
The ``Matcost'' is a number output by the MAGMA implementation of the
F4 algorithm and provides an estimate of the linear algebra cost
during the execution of the F4 algorithm.

Lastly, we also report on ``rank,'' the number of linearly independent
relations we obtain once successfully solving a PDP instance.
%
It is an important factor to consider, as it determines how many PDP
instances we need to successfully solve in order to have enough
relations to complete an index calculus attack against ECDLP.

\subsection{Experimental results}
%
\label{sec:experiment-result}

We present our experimental results for the case of $n=5$.
%
Here our factor base is determined by taking $V$ as the base field \F
p of \F{p^n}.
%
\input{result1}

We can clearly see that the PDP solving time and Matcost for twisted
Edwards curves is much smaller than the other curves for different $q$
and $m$.
%
In contrast, the degree of regularity for Montgomery and twisted
Edwards curves is smaller than the other curves in the case of $m=4$.
%
Also, we can see that the rank for Hessian and Weierstrass curves is 1
in all cases, where for Montgomery and twisted Edwards curves, it is 4
and 5 in the case of $m=3$ and $m=4$, respectively.
%
% We further analyze which terms are missing from the summation
% polynomials for curves in different forms.
% %
% We classify terms into odd vs.~even degrees.
% %
% Recall that the polynomials are expressed using elementary symmetric polynomials 
% $e_1, \dots ,e_m$.
% %
% Therefore, a monomial $e_i^j$ has odd degree only if both $i$ and $j$
% are odd.
% %
% For $m=2$, it is interesting that there are no monomials of odd degree
% only for twisted Edwards curve.
% %
% In other words, there are no terms originated from monomial such as
% $e_1$ or $e_1e_2$.
% %
% This is because the addition formula for twisted Edwards curve, based
% on which the summation polynomial is derived, consists of only even
% terms.
% %
% Therefore, when one of the 3 variables in the summation polynomial is
% substituted with the point we want to decompose, the odd-degree terms
% all vanish.

% For $m=3$, we use summation polynomial with 4 variables, which is
% obtained by taking the resultant of two summation polynomials 
% with 3 variables.
% %
% Therefore, there are some odd terms such as $e_3$ or $e_2^2e_3$.
% %
% For $m=4$, there is also no terms with odd degree.
% %
% Through calculating resultant recursively, two variables are
% eliminated, and it preserves all terms to even degree.
