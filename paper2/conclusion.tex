\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

%
In this paper, we have experimentally explored index-calculus attack
on ECDLP over different forms such as twisted Edwards curves,
Montgomery, Hessian and Weierstrass curves under the totally fair
conditions as they are isomorphic to each other over the same
definition field \F{p^n} and shown that twisted Edwards curves are
clearly faster than others.
%
We have investigated summation polynomials of all forms in detailed;
found that big differences are exist in the number of terms; and
proved that monomials of odd degrees in summation polynomial on
twisted Edwards curves does not exist.
%
We have seen that this difference causes less solving time of
index-calculus attack on ECDLP over twisted Edwards than others.
