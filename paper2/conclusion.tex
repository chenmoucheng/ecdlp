\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this research, we have shown that solving ECDLP 
through index-calculus attack on twisted Edwards curves are 
clearly faster than Montgomery, Hessian and Weierstrass curves 
under the totally fair comparison as they are isomorphic 
to one another over the same definition field \F{p^n}.
%
It is caused by missing of monomials of odd degrees 
in summation polynomial on twisted Edwards curves.
%
We conclude that ECDLP on the curves which have the 
summation polynomial of homogenous parity is easier to solve
in general.
