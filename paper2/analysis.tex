\subsection{What has brought faster solving on twisted Edwards curves}

In general, complexity to solve polynomial system is 
estimated from degree of regularity.
%
For example, 
the explanation offered by Faug\`ere, Gaudry, Hout, and Renault is
``due to the smaller degree appearing in the computation of Gr\"obner
basis of $\mathscr S_{D_n}$ in comparison with the Weierstrass case,''
cf.~Section~4.1.1 of their
paper~\cite{DBLP:journals/joc/FaugereGHR14}.
%
Unfortunately, 
this \emph{cannot} explain the difference in solving time between
(twisted) Edwards and Montgomery forms, as the highest degrees
appearing in the computation of Gr\"obner bases are \emph{the same}
for these two forms.
%
In order to reveal the reason for this, we further explore 
summation polynomial from the viewpoint of number of terms.
%
Table~\ref{tb:terms} shows the sparsity before and after Weil
restriction for each curves in the case of $m=2,3,4$.
%
As there are $n$ equations after Weil restriction, we are only showing
the average. 
%
We also include the maximum number of terms for a polynomial of degree
$2^{(m+1)-2}$ in $m$ variables.
%
\input{result2}
%
We can see that total number of terms for twisted Edwards curve is
significantly fewer than the other three curves in all cases.
%
Naturally, this could lead to smaller matrices and hence faster
solving time with the F4 algorithm.
%
We also note that the number of terms for curves 
excluding twisted Edwards curve are the same as the maximum number.

We further analyze which terms are missing from the summation
polynomials for curves in different forms.
%
We classify terms into odd vs.~even degrees.
%
From Table~\ref{tb:terms}, missing of only odd terms on twisted Edwards
curve reduce the number of terms.

\subsection{Relation between Rank and factor base}

Last but not least, we report rank information in each of the four
curves under invesigation.
%
We note that the action of $S_m$ will not contribute to rank, as
permutations of a point decomposition do not give any new relations.
%
As previewed in Section~\ref{sec:symmetry-decomposition-probability},
we would expect that the effect of the decrease in decomposition
probability due to additional symmetry in a factor base $\mathcal F$
can be offset by that of the increase in number of solutions.
%
Again using the example of group action of adding $T_2$ in
Section~\ref{sec:exploit-symmetry}, if we could get $2^{m-1}$
solutions, then the loss of the factor of $2^{m-1}$ in decomposition
probability would be compensated, and everything would be the same as
if there were no such symmetry.

Unfortunately, this proposition is \emph{false} in general.
%
Consider an example of $m=4$.
%
Let $Q_i=P_i+ T_2$ for $i=1,2,3,4$.
%
We can write down all $2^{m-1}=8$ possible ways of point decomposition
under this group action:
%
\[ \begin{aligned}
P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + P_4 = & Q_1 + Q_2 + P_3 + P_4 \\
= Q_1 + P_2 + Q_3 + P_4 = & Q_1 + P_2 + P_3 + Q_4 \\
= P_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 + P_4 = & P_1 + Q_2 + P_3 + Q_4 \\
= P_1 + P_2 + Q_3 + Q_4 = & Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 + Q_4.
\end{aligned} \]
%
It is easy to find that we have only 5 linearly independent relations
from these 8 relations, as there are nontrivial linear combinations
summing to zero, e.g.:
\[ (P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + P_4) - (Q_1 + Q_2 + P_3 + P_4) - (P_1 + P_2 +
  Q_3 + Q_4) + (Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 + Q_4) = \mathcal O.\]


As explained in Section~\ref{subsec:conditions}, the factor bases for
Montgomery and twisted Edwards curves are invariant under addition of
2-torsion point.
%
For $m=3$, we achieve maximum rank of $2^{m-1}=4$.
%
For $m=4$, as we have explained above, we can only have rank $5$, 
which is strictly less than the maximum possible rank $2^{m-1}=8$.

Finally, we note that we have not exploited any symmetry for Hessian
curves in our experiments.
%
However, the rank for experiments with Hessian curves is always 1.
%
This shows that the factor base we have chosen for Hessian curves is
\emph{not} invariant under addition of small torsion points, as the
rank would be $>1$ were it the case.
